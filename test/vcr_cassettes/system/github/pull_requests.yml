        Things to know about this PR\r\nThis will be used by the appointment request
        details view. It does not implement caching at this time. Adding caching would
        require creating a model. Given the very limited scope of the data and the
        short life of most of our caches, it probably makes more sense to cache this
        in redux on the user''s device. \r\n\r\nDoes not yet include schema. That
        will be in a subsequent PR.

        Please read our guidelines before submitting your first PR https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/code_review_guidelines.md
        -->\r\nThis is part 2 of \"RRD: prep for new contention type\", part 1 is
        PR #9206.\r\n\r\n## Description of change\r\n<!-- Please include a description
        of the change and context. What would a code reviewer, or a future dev, need
        to know about this PR in order to understand why this PR is necessary? This
        could include dependencies introduced, changes in behavior, pointers to more
        detailed documentation. The description should be more than a link to an issue.  -->\r\n\r\nIn
        preparation for adding more logic to handle additional contention types for
        RRD (RapidReadyForDecision), this PR adds refactored classes called `Form526HypertensionJob`
        and `Form526BaseJob`, which mimics `DisabilityCompensationJob` but is designed
        to be more extensible for new contention types. \r\n\r\nThe plan is to gradually
        send some claims to the new `Form526HypertensionJob`, and if errors occur,
        the claims will fall back to the existing `DisabilityCompensationJob`.  Once
        the new classes have been tested, `DisabilityCompensationJob` (and associated
        `vcr_cassettes` files) will be removed (in a future PR).\r\n\r\nThere are
        actually fewer modified lines of code than what is shown by GitHub:\r\n* The
        rspec for `Form526HypertensionJob` is a copy of the rspec for `DisabilityCompensationJob`
        to ensure equivalent behavior. Running `diff spec/jobs/rapid_ready_for_decision/disability_compensation_job_spec.rb
        spec/jobs/rapid_ready_for_decision/form526_hypertension_job_spec.rb` will
        show only name changes.\r\n* VCR cassettes were copied from the rspec for
        `DisabilityCompensationJob` - no changes were made\r\n* Running `diff app/workers/rapid_ready_for_decision/form526_base_job.rb
        app/workers/rapid_ready_for_decision/disability_compensation_job.rb` shows
        that most of the code in the new `Form526BaseJob` is copied from `DisabilityCompensationJob`.\r\n\r\n\r\n##
        Original issue(s)\r\n`DisabilityCompensationJob` was written as a prototype
        and supports a single contention type. We need to support additional contention
        types.\r\n\r\n## Things to know about this PR\r\n<!--\r\n* Are there additions
        to a `settings.yml` file? Do they vary by environment?\r\n* Is there a feature
        flag? What is it?\r\n* Is there some Sentry logging that was added? What alerts
        are relevant?\r\n* Are there any Prometheus metrics being collected? What
        Grafana dashboard were they added do?\r\n* Are there Swagger docs that were
        updated?\r\n* Is there any PII concerns or questions?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew classes
        are added in the PR, but they are not yet used. To keep this PR small, they
        will be used/enabled in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe testing

        Please read our guidelines before submitting your first PR https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/code_review_guidelines.md
        -->\r\n\r\n## Description of change\r\n<!-- Please include a description of
        the change and context. What would a code reviewer, or a future dev, need
        to know about this PR in order to understand why this PR is necessary? This
        could include dependencies introduced, changes in behavior, pointers to more
        detailed documentation. The description should be more than a link to an issue.  -->\r\n\r\nIn
        preparation for adding more logic to handle additional contention types for
        RRD (RapidReadyForDecision), this PR cleans up some code:\r\n\r\n* uses `build`
        instead of `create` for FactoryBot calls to speed up tests\r\n* uses FactoryBot
        `trait :hypertension_claim_for_increase` to DRY (don''t repeat yourself) up
        code\r\n* clarifies use of `Sidekiq::Batch` by adding comments and renaming
        methods to consistently use `*_handler` and `*_job`\r\n* removes the needless
        passing around of `first_name` as a method argument\r\n* removes unused `SubmitForm526JobStatusesError`\r\n*
        DRY up `Form526ConfirmationEmailJob` and `Form526SubmissionFailedEmailJob`\r\n*
        fixes typos\r\n\r\nNote the reduction in lines of code, which means less code
        to maintain!\r\n\r\n## Original issue(s)\r\nRRD (RapidReadyForDecision) will
        likely need to tweak the Form526Submission workflow (which uses `Sidekiq::Batch`).
        This PR does some clean up to prepare for those tweaks. \r\n\r\n## Things
        to know about this PR\r\n<!--\r\n* Are there additions to a `settings.yml`
        file? Do they vary by environment?\r\n* Is there a feature flag? What is it?\r\n*
        Is there some Sentry logging that was added? What alerts are relevant?\r\n*
        Are there any Prometheus metrics being collected? What Grafana dashboard were
        they added do?\r\n* Are there Swagger docs that were updated?\r\n* Is there
        any PII concerns or questions?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo change in behavior. Only a
        code refactor and clean up.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe testing done to verify
        the changes or any testing planned.
