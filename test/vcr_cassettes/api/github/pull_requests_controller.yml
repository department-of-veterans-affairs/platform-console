        Removes logic to determine 526 BDD (Benefits Delivery at Discharge) eligibility.\r\n-
        EVSS ignores the `bddQualified` attribute that this logic defines and EVSS
        themselves determine whether or not the submitted 526 data is BDD-qualified.\r\n  -
        So since EVSS makes their own decision and completely ignores what we''re

        if their 526 claim submission its a PIF in Use issue so the vets is aware
        that their claim was rejected.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the work, the sidekiq worker
        \"exhausted\" handler was modified so each distinct task is wrapped in a try
        rescue block.  One \"task\" failing should not prevent the other unrelated
        exhausted task from being attempted, the sidekiq exhausted handler code eats
        the exceptions raised in the exhausted handler.  For example, the job_exhausted(msg,
        STATSD_KEY_PREFIX) call was silently(sidekiq API itself eats the exceptions)throwing
        exceptions(since been fixed in a different PR) and preventing the birls rotation
        retry code from executing. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Original issue(s)\r\ndepartment-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team#41579\r\n\r\n##

        detailed documentation. The description should be more than a link to an issue.  -->\r\nChanges:\r\n-
        Updates the validations for `homelessSituationType` and `homelessnessRiskSituationType`.
        If they take a value of `\"other\"`, then `otherLivingSituation` is a required
        field with length 1. To avoid a breaking change, transform a blank value of
        `otherLivingSituation` to simply be a string with a single whitespace, i.e.
        `\" \"`.\r\n- Updates the documentation to make this more clear.\r\n- Improve
        error messaging around the various `homelessness` validations\r\n\r\n## Original

        Change Description\r\n\r\nDogStatsD was added in the gemfile.\r\n\r\nDatadog
        will be replacing Grafana with the Kubernetes integration. Grafana has the
        functionality to calculate quantiles, probability distributions, from the
        data received from Statsd. This functionality is heavily measured in the External
        Service Performance Indicators Dashboard and the monthly SLO Report. Datadog
        does not have the builtin functionality to calculate quantiles. In order to
        measure distributions in Datadog, metrics must be sent to Datadog, as a distribution
